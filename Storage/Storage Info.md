Thinking of the brain's memory as memory in a computer gives a more accurate representation. Things are held there for the carrying out of tasks in the short term, and some things stick around forever - but it can, for practical purposes, be assumed everything in memory unless moved to storage will be forgotten.

This is what this is for. The concept is known as Active Externalization, or in a less apt way as a "second brain".

This gives way to the concept of "not writing down to remember for *later*, but writing down to remember *now*." And also forever too, anything can be forgotten forever in memory but since this is stored with version history on git, even deleted files or overwritten files are kept in some form.
