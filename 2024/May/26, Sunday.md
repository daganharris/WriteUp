# Entry
Started off in early morning watching Love, Victor and the back half of Ghostbusters. Also having thoughts of self harm, which I fought off for the most part aside from the odd biting of hands.

I was productive, possibly out of anxiousness for the starting of school again. I have started the organisation of TOCU into Playbooks, Components, Sectors, and Modules. Going well, started the schema for playbooks (well, most just rules with a promise to add a schema, but hey) and added some playbook interrelationship definitions, somewhat futureproofing for if this thing ever goes public, or, even goes at all - which it will now that it's bloody organised instead of feeling like thinking up ideas in a system of maximum entropy.

And now that I can sync these bloody vaults without coughing up more dosh to yet another tech company, thanks by the way, GitHub - who **definitely** is not another tech company, I thought, after my therapist/councillor/what-is-the-difference Sarah's recommendation to start a journal, I should. I decided to make it extremely standardized and far too complicated for some reason, like I always do (who writes schemas for the organisation for the worldbuilding for the book they are writing? Me. That's who, damn right.) 

And so, here we are - in the least reviewed, most disorganised journal to be put together since the invention of the mad scientist trope. At least the jokes are good - said a sarcastic self-critical idiot, writing this. I should mention that this part is written in past tense as if it was "this morning" when it was "this morning right now, just earlier". The length of these is undefined, the subject too, apart from some metrics that I *say* will be filled in each time they perhaps won't. Let's see how this goes!

Later on. Unfortunately I could not
